Zwift Mobile API client for PHP

The Zwift Mobile API is undocumented so this project is based on the work of others who've reverse-engineered it through various means.

In particular this is a PHP port of the [zwift-mobile-api Javascript library](https://github.com/Ogadai/zwift-mobile-api).

## Getting started

### Composer package
Use composer to install this ZwiftPHP package.

```
{
    "require": {
        "darenc/ZwiftPHP": "0.1.0"
    }
}
```

### ZwiftPHP usage
#### First, authorisation and authentication
```php
<?php
include 'vendor/autoload.php';

```

#### Call an API method
```php
<?php
include 'vendor/autoload.php';

```
